/**
 * In-browser PreTeXt → HTML rendering for the full preview.
 *
 * `@pretextbook/pretext-html` runs the official PreTeXt XSLT stylesheets
 * through a WebAssembly build of libxslt, so a preview no longer needs a round
 * trip to a build server: a render costs ~400ms cold (stylesheet compile plus
 * a CDN fetch of the stylesheet bundle, once per session) and ~90ms warm.
 *
 * Two things about the dependency shape are load-bearing:
 *
 *  - **The import is dynamic.** `@pretextbook/libxslt-wasm` instantiates its
 *    1.3MB WASM module with a *top-level await*, so a static import would pay
 *    that cost on page load for every consumer, whether or not they ever open
 *    a preview. Loading it on first render keeps it off the critical path.
 *  - **Both packages are external to this library's bundle** (see
 *    vite.config.ts). The WASM binary is located with
 *    `new URL("libxslt.wasm", import.meta.url)`; leaving the packages external
 *    lets the consuming app's bundler emit and serve that asset, which is what
 *    Vite and webpack already know how to do.
 *
 * Rendering requires WebAssembly JSPI (stack switching), which not every
 * engine ships. Callers must check {@link isLocalPreviewAvailable} first and
 * fall back to a server build when it is false.
