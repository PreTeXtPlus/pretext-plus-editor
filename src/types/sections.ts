 * Every structural element in a PreTeXt project — book, article, chapter,
 * section, worksheet, etc. — is a `Division`.  Divisions are stored as a flat
 * pool of records on the host (Rails) side; hierarchy is expressed by
 * embedding `<plus:division ref="xml-id"/>` placeholder tags inside a parent
 * division's `content`.
 *
 * Type-specific aliases (`<plus:chapter ref="..."/>`, `<plus:section ref="..."/>`)
 * are accepted by the editor as equivalent to `<plus:division ref="..."/>`.
 *
 * Root divisions (type `"book"`, `"article"`, or `"slideshow"`) are the entry
 * point for building the tree.  Non-root divisions whose `xmlId` does not
 * appear in any other division's ref placeholders are considered *orphaned* and
 * are shown separately in the TOC so they can be placed.
 *
 * `"latex"` and `"markdown"` divisions are always leaf nodes for now — they
 * cannot contain child ref placeholders.  Syntax for embedded refs in those
 * formats will be added in a future release.
